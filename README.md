Simple 3D city builder [Unity]<br>
Unity UI has been created using Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.<br>
For reduce the load only View should be MonoBehaviour script.
UI development have the usual workflow of waiting for a userâ€™s input, or other triggering condition, 
sending notification of those events somewhere appropriate, deciding what to do in response, and updating 
the data accordingly. These actions clearly show the compatibility of these applications with MVC.
